A FIVE PART PLAN FOR PATENT REFORM
==================================

This is the LaTeX source code for this whitepaper. Compilation will require:

- the LaTeX packages geometry, float, indentfirst, ifxetex, fancyhdr, color,
  graphicx, dblfloatfix, hyperref, and fontspec
- if compiling with XeLaTeX, then the font Cambria

Additionally, the legcite package, which is included in this repository under
the `texmf` directory, must be installed.
